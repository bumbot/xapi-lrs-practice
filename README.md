# Purpose

A basic react app to test out writing xAPI statements and LRS functionality. Users enter their login information (actor), which then takes them to a different screen. Users may choose different buttons to press (verb), depending on the activity (object), which will be sent to https://lrs.adlnet.gov.

**Validated** statements can be viewed at http://adlnet.github.io/xapi-statement-viewer/
